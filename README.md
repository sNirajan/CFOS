# Campus Food Ordering System Concept App

## Background
Introducing Campus Food Ordering System (CFOS), a web-based food ordering system application that streamlines the ordering process for customers, employees, and admins. Developed as an in-course project for Advanced Internet Programming, this application provides a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for customers to place and track orders, for employees to manage orders, and for admins to create, update and manage restaurants, menu items, and employee records. CFOS efficiently handles communications among multiple customers and employees simultaneously and with the integration of Stripe API it now supports payment options making it more practical and convenient. Initially designed with a university campus in mind, it also offers real-time updates on orders from the restaurants. Its focus on backend development makes it a robust, fast, and secure option for any food ordering service. The application is made with express js and node js with enough styling elements to make it practical and user-friendly
