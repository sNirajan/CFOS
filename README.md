# Campus Food Ordering System Concept App

## Background
This is a web-based food ordering system application that was initially developed as an in-course project for Advanced Internet Programming course. The app provides all major functionalities of a food-ordering system including admin, employee, and customer features. Admins can create, update, and manage restaurants, menu items, and employee records, employees can view, accept/deny orders and manage orders, and customers can place and track orders as well as receieve real-time updates on their orders from the restaurants. The app can efficiently handle communications among multiple customers and employees simultaneously. It is made in the context of a university campus for a more focused and practical development approach. Also, we focused more on the backend development as it started off as a backend project, but contains enough style element as of now for practicality purposes. The app does not provide any payment option as it was not in the scope of the project's goal.
